# Palindrome Number Checker

This repository contains a simple web-based application to check if a given number is a palindrome.

## What is a Palindrome?

A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/CoderDebajyoti/Palindrome-Number-Checker-.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd palindrome-checker
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the application.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic to check if a number is a palindrome.

## How It Works

1. Enter a number in the input field.
2. Click the "Check" button.
3. The result will be displayed below, indicating whether the number is a palindrome or not.
